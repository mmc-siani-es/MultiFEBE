version 0.75-RC4

Found and fixed a bug in sdf_read, sdf_read_f77, and sdf_details, (for C and
fortran-callable versions of SDF) in which
a segmentation fault occurs if a negative value of "order" for a given dataset
is given as one of the calling arguments.  Those functions now test to 
ensure order >=0 before attempting to read or provide "details" on the dataset.
A Similar bug (no testing for negative values of "order") was found and fixed 
in the IDL versions of sdf_delete, sdf_insert, and sdf_replace.

For IDL version, have now adopted test versions of sdf_read_var.pro 
(modified by Brian Welsch) and sdf_read_all.pro (modified by Maria Kazachenko) 
in which the "quiet" keyword was added to the calling sequence to 
suppress the printing of the sdf_query output.

version 0.75-RC3

Fixed a bug, found by Dave Bercik, in which zero or negative values of nbpw
are not flagged as errors, and writes were attempted with no warning or error
messages.  Fixes for this bug were added to sdf_write, sdf_replace, and
sdf_insert.  I believe the IDL versions of these procedures are not affected
by this bug; no changes to the IDL source code made.

Feb. 3, 2012, GHF

version 0.75-RC2

Added the fortran callable subroutine sdf_ndat_f77(fname, ndat) and 
the C function i4 sdf_ndat(fname) to return the number of datasets in
a file without printing anything to stdout.  sdf_details had its default
(no-error) print statements removed.  IDL version should be unchanged from
0.74-1 I believe.  This version has *not* been tested against anything but
Mac OSX (Lion) and the windows zip file has not been included.

October 8, 2009 GHF

version 0.74-1

Fixed bug in the IDL versions of sdf_insert.pro and sdf_replace.pro in which
sdf files with only 1 dataset were inadvertently removed.  Fixed another bug
in which sdf_delete.pro and sdf_replace.pro had an incorrect check on illegal 
values of the dataset to be replaced or deleted.  The C/Fortran callable
libraries did not have this bug and remain unchanged.

Aug. 23, 2007 GHF

version 0.74

Fixed a bug in C/Fortran version of sdf_rb, in which the code did not print
any diagnostics if one tried to read past the end of the file.

sdf file format is now an option for both the ANMHD and RADMHD mhd codes.

Added capability of having a user-defined value of the initial header
size of the file, to both the C/Fortran versions and the IDL versions
of sdf_write, sdf_insert, and sdf_replace.  In the C/Fortran versions,
this value can be set at compile time by using the -DHINITSZ=nnnn flag.
This can be edited as part of CCFLAGS if so desired.  In the IDL versions,
this can be changed by using a new keyword in sdf_write, sdf_insert, and
sdf_replace, namely hinitsz=nnnn.  Here, nnnn is whatever integer value
in bytes you desire.  In earlier versions, this is hard-wired to be 2000,
and 2000 bytes is still the default value that is used.

What is the significance of this?  If you add enough datasets to a file
that the header information can't be safely stored in the initial 2000 bytes,
then the entire file has to be "moved down" on the disk to make room for
the expanded header information.  If the file is very large, like over 1-2GB,
this can be very time consuming.  Typically, for a 2000 byte initial header 
area, this occurs after 50-70 datasets or so.  If you will be storing many more
datasets than this in a single file, it will be much more efficient to use
a larger value of HINITSZ, as the number of times one of these "move down"
operations has to be performed is much smaller.  On the other hand, for
files containing a small number of datasets, making HINITSZ larger just
results in some wasted space that isn't used.  I find the default value of
2000 works fine for most of the cases I've used, but occasionally, when
the file contains hundreds or thousands of datasets, it makes more sense to
set HINITSZ to 10000 or 20000.

The IDL version of sdf_write_all now creates a new output file by default,
rather than appending to an existing file.  The addition of the /append
keyword will result in the old behavior.

Added cindcalc_f77, memcalcc_f77 functions, which are fortran callable
functions that convert between multi-dimensional and 1-d array indices, and that
use the default fortran index ranges (ie 1 to n instead of 0 to n-1).

Feb. 26, 2006 GHF

version 0.73

Fixed a bug in the C/Fortran versions of sdf_insert, 
sdf_replace in which the current file position was not returned to the 
correct location if the header area had been expanded.

Added the ability to use default 64-bit integers from Fortran programs that
call sdf functions.  To enable this, I added an environment variable INTF_64
which can be set at compile time with the -DINTF_64 flag to the C compiler
(the default is that this is not set).  Two versions of the sdf library 
are now compiled when you type "make", namely libsdf.a, which uses 
the standard fortran integer size, namely an integer is half the size of 
a double precision variable, and libsdf_if64.a, which assumes a default 
fortran integer size of 64 bits.  Using 64-bit fortran integers by default 
is enabled with a flag for most fortran compilers (-i8 for ifort and g95, and 
-fdefault-integer-8 for gfortran, for example).  Fortran programs using these 
options should then be linked to the libsdf_if64.a library with 
the -lsdf_if64 flag.

Note that it is still the case that even if one is using default fortran
integer sizes of 32-bits, that some of the arguments are required to be
64-bit integers (integer*8 or kind=8).  This is required to accomodate very
large datasets.  See the SDF_USAGE_NOTES.txt file for details.

There are versions of the fortran test programs assuming 64-bit default
integers in the Makefile.  They have a trailing _if64 in the filenames of
the executables, and they can all be compiled with "make all_if64".
You will need to check that the flags F77_IF64 and F95_IF64 are correctly
defined for your desired fortran compiler.

Added "warnings" to the Makefile, which just reports all warnings from the
compiler (-Wall) when trying to compile sdf_subs.c and sdf_browse.c .


Oct. 17, 2006 GHF

version 0.72

With Yuhong Fan's help (Yuhong works at HAO/NCAR), have modified the 
code slightly so that it compiles and runs on the IBM SPX series running AIX.  
Modified sdf_subs.h to add
# define _LARGE_FILES 1
into the beginning of the include file.  This appears to be necessary to
enable large file support on IBM SPX systems using the xlC_r compiler, 
which seems to ignore the large-file support compiler flags that seem to 
work with most of the other compilers.

For IBM SPX systems, it then appears to be necessary that the
# include <sdf_subs.h> line precede all other include statements and
definitions in any C source code that calls SDF functions (no apparent
restrictions on Fortran code that calls SDF routines).

Also had some problems with the is_big_endian() function on IBM SPX, where
it incorrectly identified the machine as being small-endian.  Made some slight
changes to the function which seems to make it behave correctly, and added
an error exit for the function.  Thus far this new function also behaves 
correctly on all other platforms tested.

Added some modifications to integer and masking arithmetic in
the rindcalc, readmask, and writemask functions
to increase their speed within sdf_transpose.  
Speed improvements in the sdf_transpose function seem to be ~10-20% or so.

Oct. 3, 2006 GHF

version 0.71

Jack Vernetti wrote a much faster version of the byte-swapping function,
which speeded up the test programs on small-endian machines by anywhere from
10-50%.  This version includes the new byteswap function.

Sept. 28, 2006 GHF

version 0.70

After much soul-searching, decided to make a non-backwards compatible change
for the Fortran-callable SDF subroutines:  All references to the "dims" array
(array of dimensions) now assume that dims is an array of 64-bit integers 
(integer*8 or integer (kind=8) ).  This is necessary to ensure that the I/O
of very large arrays, as will surely occur in the future, will be handled
correctly.  All of the example programs included were updated to reflect this
change.  This change does not affect the files themselves, since the
dimensions are converted to string tokens within the files.  But it will affect
the Fortran calling software that reads or writes to the files.  The C and IDL
interfaces were not changed, since they were already compatible with 64-bit
dimensions.

Fixed some minor bugs that Rick Devore found when compiling the code 
on altix and origin SGI platforms.  

Added IDL versions of sdf_wb and sdf_rb, to facilitate the analysis of
files written in C or Fortran with sdf_wb and sdf_rb.  The calling sequence
of sdf_wb and sdf_rb in IDL are somewhat different than in the Fortran/C calls.

Aug. 18, 2006 GHF

version 0.69

Added fseeko_f77 and ftello_f77, to mirror the C functions fseeko and ftello,
to the set of primitive fortran subroutines.  This means that pretty much
the full range of C low-level binary disk I/O capabilities can be done 
from a Fortran program.

Changed the functions sdf_wb,
sdf_rb, and sdf_wb_f77 and sdf_rb_f77, to add a file pointer argument.
When the file pointer is set to 0 (or NULL in C), the file is opened and closed
within the sdf_wb, sdf_rb functions, but when it is non-zero, it is treated
as a file pointer, and the pointer is used for file i/o and the file is not
opened or closed within the read/write functions.  The objective was to 
provide the user with some additional control over the file I/O.  For example,
the I/O can be done more efficiently if the user does their own opening and
closing, but this means more coding effort.  In a calling Fortran program,
this argument should be declared as a 64-bit integer.  This should make it 
run correctly on either a 32-bit or 64-bit system.

July 20, 2006 GHF

version 0.68

The names of the primitive fortran versions of the C functions in version 0.67
(like sdf_fread_f77) were dangerously close to the sdf read function
(sdf_read_f77).  Plus these primitives really have nothing to do with
sdf files per se.  Therefore, the names of the fortran callable primitives
were changed to be their C name (like fread) with an _f77 suffix.  Also
added fflush_f77(fp) where fp file pointer returned from fopen_f77.  This
results in pretty much all of the C i/o functions being supported from 
Fortran.  The original version of fflush_f77, which flushed stdout only, has
been changed to ffstdout_f77.  Also fixed a duplicated entry in Makefile for
xtestrbwb.

July 19, 2006 GHF

version 0.67

In response to Rick's latest email, put a call to sdf_file_truncate into
sdf_wb so that file is truncated at the position last written.

Also added Fortran callable interfaces to essentially all of the basic low-level
C i/o functions, plus things like sdf_ftc_f77 (file truncation),  the SDF
byteswapping function, etc.  This would make in possible to micro-engineer
your own data format completely from within Fortran. There is a new test
program, test_prim.f, which tests all of these functions in an example which
makes a primitive large-endian binary file completly from Fortran calls of
these low level routines.  This is now in the make file as the test 
executable xtp.  For now, these low-level routines are not documented within
the SDF_USAGE_NOTES.txt file.  For more information, see the example file
test_prim.f .

July 18, 2006 GHF

version 0.66

In response to email conversation with Rick Devore at NRL, introduced
new functions to just perform primitive large-endian binary read/write in 
the SDF library without all of the meta-data included in the SDF files.  The new
functions are sdf_rb and sdf_wb (in C) and sdf_rb_f77 and sdf_wb_f77
(Fortran callable versions).  The user then has to keep track of where things
are in the file on their own.  These primitive functions allow one to start
reading or writing anywhere in the file.  The functions are "large file"
capable, ie one can read/write files larger than 2GB.  The IDL version of
these primitives hasn't been written yet.

July 9, 2006 GHF

version 0.65

Added a bunch of new functions to the C user interface to make it easier to
use allocatable multi-dimensional arrays from C and do the I/O with SDF.
To create a multi-dimensional, dynamically allocated array that
can be used in e.g. sdf_write, one can use the functions sdf_mk_2d, sdf_mk_3d,
sdf_mk_4d, or sdf_mk_5d to create 2d through 5d arrays which are indexable
with standard [i][j][k]... syntax.  To convert the 1-d array that sdf_read
returns into a multi-dimensional array, the functions sdf_1d_to_2d,
sdf_1d_to_3d, sdf_1d_to_4d, and sdf_1d_to_5d will do the job.  The resulting
multi-dimensional arrays are then freed with the sdf_free-2d, sdf_free_3d,
sdf_free_4d, or sdf_free_5d functions.  These functions are now documented in 
SDF_USAGE_NOTES.txt.

There are a bunch of new test programs:  test_sdf_3d.c, test_sdf_4d.c, 
test_sdf_5d.c, and sdf_test_complex_c89.c and sdf_test_complex_c99.c, which
have entries in the Makefile, and which create executables x3d, x4d, x5d,
xtc89 and xtc99, respectively.  The test_sdf_large.c test program, which is
used to create the xlarge executable in the Makefile, now uses sdf_mk_2d
and sdf_1d_to_2d.  The sdf_test_complex test programs use the sdf_mk_2d
and sdf_1d_to_2d functions (C99 version) and sdf_mk_3d and sdf_1d_to_3d
functions (C89 version).

June 27, 2006 GHF

version 0.64

Found and fixed bugs in the C/Fortran versions of sdf_replace, sdf_insert,
and sdf_delete, in which the original versions append a \0 at the end of
a buffer containing the strings in
the header area.  In some circumstances, this resulted in the value of
hdrpos being 1 byte larger than it should have been, resulting in a null
terminator being stuck into the middle of the header buffer in later calls
to sdf_write, causing havoc when using complicated combinations of 
sdf_replace and sdf_write.  Deleting the final \0 when writing out the 
buffer in sdf_insert, sdf_replace, and sdf_delete appears to fix that problem.

June 22, 2006 GHF

version 0.63

Found and fixed bugs in the new test programs test_sdf_large.c and 
test_sdf_3d.c .  The allocation of the pointers in the original versions
used sizeof(float) instead of sizeof(float *).  This caused these 2
test programs to crash on 64-bit systems.  There are a few more comments
in these codes now as to what their purpose is.  Also updated the
documentation in SDF_USAGE_NOTES.txt (and in the file MULTI_DIM_ARRAYS_C.txt)
to reflect the fixing of these bugs.

June 20, 2006 GHF

version 0.62

Discovered a name conflict between sdf's "file_truncate" function in C, and one
of exactly the same name in the cfitsio library.  Renamed the sdf version to be
"sdf_file_truncate".  

Found and fixed serious bugs in IDL versions of move_dn, move_up
in which the code tried to read/write a buffer of zero bytes length if there
was no "remainder" in the difference between the number of bytes to shift the
file and the buffer size.

June 8, 2006 GHF

version 0.61

Fixed small bugs in sdf_insert, sdf_replace, sdf_replace (C/Fortran versions)
for opening files without checking to see if they'd been closed first.  

Added a new test program, xtest_sdf_edit, which allows one to test the 
functionality of sdf_insert/sdf_delete/sdf_replace from a C calling program.  
The syntax of the program is xtest_sdf_edit <filename>, and it interactively 
queries you to edit the datasets.  For insertion/replacement, it uses a dataset
consisting of a 101 length floating array equal to sin (pi x), for x in [0,1].
The program has not much practical use other than for testing the editing
functions, and providing examples in the code for how to use sdf_insert,
sdf_replace, and sdf_delete .  To make the test program, just type
"make xtest_sdf_edit".

June 2, 2006 GHF

version 0.60

A new IDL function was added, sdf_read_arr(fname,labtest).  This works much
like sdf_read_var(fname, labtest) except for the following difference:
sdf_read_var returns a *single* dataset for which labtest matches the dataset
label -- but only the first occurrence of the dataset in the file.  
sdf_read_arr, on the other hand, returns an "array" of results that 
correspond to *all* occurrences of datasets for which labtest matches the 
dataset label.  This is particularly useful if a single SDF file contains
a "time series" of the same variable written repeatedly to the file.  
Then the time evolution of a given variable can be recovered with a 
single call to sdf_read_arr.

Many local unused variables were removed from the C source code, and the 
following functions were added:  sdf_malloc, sdf_free, sdf_create_id, 
sdf_free_id.  These functions are now the best way to manage memory from 
C programs that call the SDF functions -- sdf_create_id to create the 
id structures that sdf_write needs, and sdf_free_id to free those structures.  
Data read in with sdf_read should be freed with sdf_free to avoid possible 
inconsistencies between the versions of malloc and free in the sdf library 
and those used in the calling program.  Empirically, this seems to be 
particularly important in Windows.  The MinGW compiled sdf.dll and sdf.def 
files are now distributed along with the source code, for those that want 
to use sdf in Windows and don't want to install MinGW.  An example Makefile
file that works with the MSVC's (Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler) 
nmake is now also included in the distribution (as Makefile_msvc), which 
has examples of how the included sdf.dll can be compiled into 
other programs from MSVC.  Some more detail on this is provided in the updated
version of INSTALL.txt .

May 18, 2006 GHF

version 0.59-3:

Inserted some function prototypes that were missing
in sdf_subs.h, and switched all C++ style comments to C-style
comments in sdf_subs.h and sdf_subs.c in an effort to make the source 
code more portable.  Converted expressions using pointer arithmetic on
pointers to void variables to pointers to char variables to satisfy SUN
compiler.  Added entries into Makefile to compile the fortran executable
examples xtestf77, xtest_dyn_f95, and xtest_transp_f95.

April 28, 2006 GHF

version-0.59-2:

Found and fixed a bug in sdf_write, in which fopen and fclose calls were not
matched.  Symptom was a refusal to open the file after about 1000
datasets had been written from a fortran 77 program.  Problem appears to be
fixed.

April 17, 2006 GHF

version-0.59-1:

Fixed small bugs in rindcalc, cindcalc in which a declaration appeared after
an executable stmt, not allowed in version 2.96 of gcc

April 13, 2006 GHF

Discovered that the atoll (ascii to long long) function doesn't work right
on Loraine's MAC laptop (OS 10.3.9, acc. to her).  Switched out the 
atoll call for our own homebrew function, atopos, whose source is now 
included in sdf_subs.c .

Also discovered that on her MAC, need a -s option
added to the ar -r command to make the library build correctly.

April 6, 2006, GHF

version 0.59

Fixed small bug in output_int64 in which last 2 characters in output buffer 
were being set repeatedly in a loop instead of after the loop.

April 6, 2006, GHF

Version 0.58:

Fixed serious bug in sdf_transpose_f77, in which id->nbpw was not
being assigned to *nbpwf77.

Fixed serious bugs in IDL versions of sdf_replace and sdf_insert in 
version 0.54.  There was an outer and an inner loop both indexed by i;
the inner loop is now indexed by ii.

Changed the memcalc function to be named memcalcr (row major), and added
a new function memcalcc (assuming column major addressing).

Confirmed using tests of sdf_delete and sdf_insert
that existing "windows" version of 
file_truncate in sdf_subs.c correctly changes the sizes of "large" files 
bigger than the 32-bit 2GB limit, at least on NTFS partitions in Windows XP.

Commented out some of the non-error print statements in sdf_read.

Replaced Jack Vernetti's version of output_int64 with a simpler version.

March 23, 2006, George H. Fisher

Major Changes from version 0.52:

A new capability to perform a multi-dimensional in-place transpose of a dataset,
either after being read in, or before being written out, has been created
via the sdf_transpose (C and IDL) and sdf_transpose_f77 (Fortran) functions.
The C and fortran callable versions use the vacancy cycle tracking method
of Ding (2001) to do the transpose in place, with little additional
needed memory; the IDL version just uses the IDL transpose and reverse 
functions, where the former does apparently introduce a temporary array
to do the transpose.

March 9, 2006, George H. Fisher

Major Changes from version 0.43:

A Makefile was created for compiling the sdf software into a library
and an executable sdf file browser, sdf_browse.  Typing make should
create the library libsdf.a and the executable sdf_browse.  Becoming
root and typing make install will put the library, include file sdf_subs.h,
and sdf_browse into the "regular" spots in the /usr/local tree.  If you
want to put them somewhere else, modify the Makefile.  Typing make uninstall
should remove these components from the "regular" spots.  More details
on compiling the code and compiling fortran and C programs that use the
sdf library can be found in INSTALL.txt.

All fortran callable functions now come in all 3 flavors:  no trailing 
underscore, 1 trailing underscore, and 2 trailing underscores.
This is necessary to accomodate different fortran compilers, which 
expect different numbers of trailing underscores, sigh.

sdf_read_f77 no longer uses malloc and memcpy to transfer the data into
the data space in the fortran calling program.  This increases the amount
of data which can be read in from a single dataset.  The fortran calling
program must initially dimension or dynamically allocate enough memory to
handle the data being read in.

There are new sdf functions, sdf_labmatch and sdf_labmatch_f77 which will
find all dataset orders for which the "label" is matched by a user-input
string.  There is also an IDL version of sdf_labmatch.

There are new sdf functions, sdf_details and sdf_details_f77, which return
all of the necessary metadata about a chosen dataset (but does not return
the data itself).  There is also an IDL version of sdf_details .

The file truncation functions for both *nix and win32 are now called
file_truncate, and are now hopefully both defined in a large-file compliant
way.  The old method involved the use of chsize in win32, which evidently
is not large file compliant.  Most of the information for the win32 version 
was gleaned from newsgroups of people wanting to compile various linux 
applications for windows, and needing the file i/o to be large file compliant.  

New IDL-only procedures, sdf_read_all and sdf_write_all,
use sdf_read and sdf_write to read all datasets from an sdf file
into IDL variables at the "$MAIN$" level in IDL, and to write each variable
from that level into an sdf file, respectively.  The name of each IDL
variable is equal to the "label" field for each dataset.  Obviously, this
will only work correctly if each dataset has a unique label in a given 
sdf file.  These procedures use the IDL scope_varfetch and execute functions.
They will only work in versions 6.1 or later of IDL, since scope_varfetch
was only introduced in 6.1.

Also added a new function, sdf_read_var in IDL, which reads a dataset for
which the label field matches a user's input label field.
