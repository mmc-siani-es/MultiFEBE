MultiFEBE is a Multi-domain Finite Element and Boundary Element linear mechanics solver. 

It implements several mixed-dimensional couplings between Finite Elements (FE) and Boundary Elements (BE), particularly those developed in our [research team](http://www.mmc.siani.es/) (see our [publications](http://www.mmc.siani.es/papers-in-referred-journals/)). It also implements ordinary and crack boundary elements for inviscid fluids (acoustic medium), elastic solid and poroelastic medium, allowing the interaction between regions of different kind of materials.
